# CULSIM Implementation Plan

## Project Overview
CULSIM is a Chinese cultivation mythology-inspired incremental game with roguelike elements. This plan outlines the implementation of all core systems including cultivation, elements, combat, reincarnation, artifacts, alchemy, and life events.

**UI Platform**: The game will be implemented as a web-based application, served as a static webpage on GitHub Pages. All UI components will be built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript/TypeScript, with no server-side dependencies.
