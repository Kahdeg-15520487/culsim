# CULSIM Implementation Plan

## Project Over### **UI Platform**: The game will be implemented as a web-based application, served as a static webpage on GitHub Pages. All UI components will be built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript/TypeScript, with no server-side dependencies.

**Additional Features Implemented**:
- **i18n System**: Full internationalization support with English and Vietnamese translations for all game text
- **Manual Breakthrough System**: Removed automatic breakthroughs, added manual player-controlled realm advancement
- **Meridian Opening Costs**: Each meridian opening attempt consumes 1/4th of the qi requirement with detailed failure logging
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Full test suite covering all major game systems and mechanics

**Current Status**: Phase 1 (Core Architecture & Foundation) is 100% complete. Phase 2.1 (Basic Cultivation Mechanics) is 100% complete. Phase 2.2 (Realm Progression System) is 100% complete. Phase 2.3 (Element System & Complementarity) is 100% complete. Phase 3.1 (Combat System) and Phase 3.2 (Life Events System) are 100% complete. Phase 5.1 (Web UI) is 100% complete. Additional features implemented: i18n system, manual breakthrough controls, meridian opening costs/failure logging, and comprehensive testing.
